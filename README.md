# Automated Dominos Pizza Order

Created using Python, requests, Selenium and BeautifulSoup

This program will order Dominos pizza based on the following user input:
- Physical Address
- Order Option
- Pizza Choices
- Name
- Phone number
- Email address
- Payment Method

I used Beautiful Soup to scrap all the dominos voucher codes

Once all information has been entered, including voucher code, the program will order the pizza.
